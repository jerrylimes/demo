            Working Horses With Jim: A Pause, A Legacy & A Lot Of Heart
        </p>

        <p class="normal-text">
            Today the entire StreamHorse community sends its love, support, and deep appreciation to Jim and Brenda
            Gordon, the heartbeat behind Working Horses With Jim, the beautifully shot, deeply authentic, and wildly
            beloved YouTube channel with more than 115,000 loyal subscribers. Their announcement that they are taking a
            break from creating new content while Jim recovers from hand surgery comes as a quiet shock across the draft
            horse world, but anyone who knows Jim understands that healing cannot be rushed. The work he does, and the
            life he lives, requires hands that are steady, strong, and fully restored.

            The roots of that life run deep. Jim and Brenda moved to Moira, New York in 1991 and built the Gordon Family
            Farm and Sawmill into a diversified, season-driven operation. Today the farm shifts fluidly with the needs
            of the land and community. Jim saws and sells live edge slabs and hardwood lumber. He harvests logs with the
            horses and supplies them to local sawmills for dimensional lumber. Together they manage standing timber
            responsibly and raise a small beef herd with care. Summers bring haying, again with the horses doing the
            work. Winters, when weather allows, transform the property into a postcard with sleigh rides to a heated
            cabin beside their ice skating pond, a place where families gather and time seems to soften around the
            edges.

            The YouTube channel grew out of Jim’s desire to share what he has learned from decades of working with draft
            horses. His purpose has always been at once humble and ambitious. He wants to honor the older generation who
            taught him, pass on the techniques and mindset required to work horses well, and help people remember that a
            life powered by horses is still possible today. He has always believed in pairing the strength and
            intelligence of horses with the efficiency of modern machinery, blending the best of both worlds. In his
            videos you see horses logging, plowing, haying, delivering sleighs full of families through fresh snow, even
            competing from time to time. What stands out most is not the variety of jobs but the seamless way Jim and
            the horses communicate. You watch long enough and you begin to understand why so many viewers feel that
            these animals aren’t just partners in labor, but partners in life.
